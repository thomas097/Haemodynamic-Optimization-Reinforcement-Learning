This folder includes the state representation learning tasks used to learn representations of patient states for our Q-learning experiments.

It includes:

- A **behavior cloning** objective (BC)
- An **action-conditioned forward dynamics modeling** objective (FM)
- An **autoencoding** / observation reconstruction objective (AE)
- A **multi-task** learning objective (MT) as a convex combination of the above
